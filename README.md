# ATLAS

## [MAJOR WIP: EXPECT MISCALCULATIONS AND ERRORS — DO NOT RELY ENTIRELY ON OUTPUT]

ATLAS (Automated Terrain and Luminance Analysis System) is a local vision AI pipeline that estimates geolocation data — longitude, latitude band, and biome — from a sequence of timestamped landscape camera images. It analyzes shadow angles, vegetation, and geology across hundreds of frames to derive a best-guess location.

Originally built for the [Waterfall Hunt](https://waterfallhunt.com) treasure hunt investigation.

## ⚠️ Before you run this — read this first

**ATLAS requires a vision-language model running locally.** It will not work — and will not fail with a clear error — if no model backend is active. Running it without a VLM loaded will produce meaningless output (random/default coordinates, often landing in the ocean).

**You need, in this order:**

1. Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
2. Download and load a vision-capable model, `qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct` is what ATLAS is tested against
3. Start the local server in LM Studio (Developer tab → confirm it shows "Running")
4. Only then run `python atlas.py`

If you skip step 2 or 3, ATLAS has nothing to extract shadow/terrain data from and the output is not representative of how the tool works.
(If your hardware cannot run a Local AI Model you will have to run using the DEMO version of ATLAS which uses random generated coordinates, any images used in [DEMO] Mode will be useless)

## What it actually needs to produce a real estimate

This is the part that matters most for testing - ATLAS cannot guess a location from random or unrelated photos. It needs:

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **40+ images minimum** | Enough data points to average shadow angle and reduce noise |
| **One single physical location** | All images must be the same place - different locations confuse the averaging |
| **Spanning sunrise to sunset (ideally a full day or more)** | Solar noon is derived from the shortest-shadow frames — without daylight range, there's no signal |
| **Consistent shadow-casting objects in frame** (rocks, trees, posts, structures) | The model needs something to estimate shadow angle/length from |
| **Filenames with UTC timestamps**: `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` (e.g. `20260518T230318Z.png`) | This is how ATLAS derives time-of-day; without it, frames are skipped entirely |

**What will NOT work:**
- A handful of random photos from different places
- Images without the timestamp filename format
- Synthetic/mock data with no real shadow geometry, this will produce nonsense coordinates which is expected, not a bug

## Quick test image-set

[SAMPLE SET HERE](
I recommend testing with a known-good dataset first before trying your own images, so you can confirm ATLAS is working correctly before troubleshooting your own data.

## Setup

**Requirements:**
* Python 3.10+
* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) running locally with `qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct` (or similar vision model) loaded
* A folder of landscape images meeting the requirements above

```bash
pip install Pillow numpy requests
```

**1. Set your images folder**

Open the script and edit the config section at the top:

```python
IMAGES_DIR = Path(r"C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\images")
```

**2. Set your model endpoint**

```python
MODEL_ENDPOINTS = [
    "qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct"
]
```

**3. Run**

```bash
python atlas.py
```

**4. Check outputs**

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `output.csv` | Per-image data: shadow angle/length, plants, rocks, volcanic features |
| `summary.txt` | Solar noon, longitude estimate, habitat classification |
| `skipped.txt` | Frames skipped (too dark or missing timestamp) |

---

## Image filename format

Filenames must contain a UTC timestamp in this exact format:

```
20260518T230318Z.png
```

Anything before or after the timestamp is ignored. Images without a valid timestamp are automatically skipped and logged to `skipped.txt`.

---

## How the estimate is derived (for context, not required reading to test)

1. The vision model estimates shadow length (short/medium/long) per frame
2. Frames with the shortest shadows are grouped by calendar date, this approximates solar noon
3. Per-day solar noon values are averaged across the full dataset
4. An Equation of Time correction is applied using the Julian day of the dataset midpoint
5. Longitude is calculated from the corrected solar noon offset
6. Habitat/biome is classified by tallying vegetation and geology indicators across all frames

Shadow angles use a **circular mean** (not arithmetic mean) to avoid wraparound errors at the 0°/360° boundary.

---

## Known limitations (current WIP state)

* Coordinate accuracy is currently inconsistent, multiple tests that were run were off target by several thousand km due to a known boundary/geometry bug in the longitude derivation, not the inference pipeline itself
* Shadow-angle estimation can return `unknown` for certain ambiguous vectors
* Model compatibility is currently strongest with `qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct` - other vision models may produce inconsistent structured output and break parsing
* This is a research tool, not a production-ready geolocation system. Treat all output as a rough estimate requiring human verification

## Questions?

If something isn't working as described above, the most likely cause is either:
1. No model backend running (see the warning at the top)
2. Test images not meeting the dataset requirements above

If you've confirmed both of those and it's still not working, please reach out. I'm happy to help debug.

## Origin

Built during a 5-day investigation into the [Waterfall Hunt](https://waterfallhunt.com), a real-world treasure hunt involving over $15k in gold coins and USDC hidden somewhere in the American Southwest. ATLAS was developed to systematically analyze trail camera feeds using local AI rather than relying on manual, frame-by-frame human inspection.
